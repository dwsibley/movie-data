This project originated from a coding assignement described [here](mddocs/original-assignment.md).  This is an exploration of FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, GCP and other tech as a solution for an API to manage movie data.  At this time a free (from kaggle.com) Netflix data set is being used.

The current status of the assignment is described [here](mddocs/assignment-status.md).

This has been an educational and fun project so far.  I made a [todo](mddocs/todo.md) list for some things I would like to work on even after turning in this assignment.
